# General information
This Git repository contains codes for the '**Time-marching neural operatorâ€“FE coupling: AI-accelerated physics modeling**' paper published in [Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2025.118319)

## initial motivations
The motivation is to establish a FE-NO coupling framework using a Schwartz alternating method to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pretrained DeepONet, while the remainder is handled by a FEM. FEM requires extremely fine meshes to capture the nonlinear behaviors, which is computationally expensive; while DeepONets are non-linear mappings and can be pretrained offlines, which cost almost no time during the simulations. The combination of the two methods are expected to significantly improve the computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of the solution.

# Application 
## Elasto-dynamic 
Note that yellow square indicates the NO domain. The below GIF shows the plane wave propagation in FE and FE-NO coupling framework, along with the error evolution versus time step. The error is not exponentially growing while it evolves in erratic manner, demonstrating the limitating influence of autogressive error accumulation.

## linear elasticity and hyper elasticity
The results for linear staticity under static loading and hyper-elasticity under quasi-static loading are shown in folder [linear staticity static loading
](https://github.com/Centrum-IntelliPhysics/Time-Marching-Neural-Operator-FE-Coupling/tree/main/Linear%20Elasticity%20Static%20loading) and [hyper-elasticity quasi-static loading](https://github.com/Centrum-IntelliPhysics/Time-Marching-Neural-Operator-FE-Coupling/tree/main/Hyper-elasticity%20quasi-static%20loading), respectively.

# Method
To achieve FE-NO coupling in dynamic problems, it requires both the spatial and temporal dimension coupling. The spatial coupling is achieved by a Schwartz alternating method at overlapping boundary, while the temporal coupling is achieved by Newmark-beta method integration in DeepONet (i.e., time-marching DeepONet). While in static or quasi-static problems, only the spatial coupling is needed.

## Time-marching DeepONet structures 
The time-marching DeepONet structure is inspired by the Newmark-beta method, which consists of two branch networks and one trunk network: **branch1** encodes the displacement boundary condition at current time step, **branch2** encodes the displacement and velocity across the domain at previous time step, and the **trunk** network only encodes the spatial coordinates. Such DeepONets can be directly trained by residual loss and boundary loss without additional data, bring about a physics-informed DeepONet.
