## Initial motivations
The primary motivation is to establish a FE-NO coupling framework based on domain decomposition method to solve complex and nonlinear regions by a pretrained DeepONet, while the remainder is handled by a FEM. The FEM requires extremely fine meshes to capture the highly nonlinear behaviors, which is computationally expensive; while DeepONets are non-linear mappings and can be pretrained offlines, which cost negligible time during the simulations.

The coupling of the two solvers is expected to leverage their complementary strengths, leading to a significant enhancement in computational efficiency and robustness while maintaining solution accuracy.

# Application 
## Elasto-dynamic 
The yellow square denotes the NO domain. The GIF below illustrates plane wave propagation within the FE and FE-NO coupling frameworks, alongside the temporal evolution of the error. The error does not grow exponentially but evolves erratically, indicating the limiting influence of autoregressive error accumulation.

## Linear elasticity and hyper elasticity
The results for linear staticity under static loading and hyper-elasticity under quasi-static loading are shown in folder [linear staticity static loading
](https://github.com/Centrum-IntelliPhysics/Time-Marching-Neural-Operator-FE-Coupling/tree/main/Linear%20Elasticity%20Static%20loading) and [hyper-elasticity quasi-static loading](https://github.com/Centrum-IntelliPhysics/Time-Marching-Neural-Operator-FE-Coupling/tree/main/Hyper-elasticity%20quasi-static%20loading), respectively.

# Method
To achieve FE-NO coupling in dynamic problems, it requires both the spatial and temporal dimension coupling. The spatial coupling is achieved by a Schwartz alternating method at overlapping boundary, while the temporal coupling is achieved by Newmark-beta method integration in DeepONet (i.e., time-marching DeepONet). While in static or quasi-static problems, only the spatial coupling is needed.

## Time-marching DeepONet structures 
The time-marching DeepONet structure is inspired by the Newmark-beta method, which consists of two branch networks and one trunk network: **branch1** encodes the displacement boundary condition at current time step, **branch2** encodes the displacement and velocity across the domain at previous time step, and the **trunk** network only encodes the spatial coordinates. Such DeepONets can be trained directly using residual and boundary loss functions, without requiring additional data, resulting in a physics-informed DeepONet architecture.
